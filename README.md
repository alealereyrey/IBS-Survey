Statistical significant differences were observed among gastroenterology subspecialties in the treatment of IBS-D with respect to the efficacy of diet, amitriptyline and antibiotics other than rifaximin, and regarding the effectiveness for bisacodyl/ picosulfate and antibiotics in the treatment of IBS-C.

### **Conclusion** 

The most common pathophysiological mechanism in IBS-D is stress. The vast majority of respondents consider that the main goal of treatment is the improvement of the
quality of life, over symptomatic relief. None of the drugs is considered very effective in the treatment of the different IBS variants by at least 50% of those surveyed. Statisticaly significant differences were observed in the proportion of monthly consultations for IBS regarding to age and in the effectiveness considered for some treatments in relation to the subspecialty of physicians. The therapeutic approach to IBS by Argentine gastroenterologists is varied and somewhat heterogeneous, resulting in a still inappropriate management of this condition.
